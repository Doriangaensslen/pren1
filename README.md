# Welcome the my Pren1 Repo!

This repo does contain some of the Key Scripts and some of our Project Code to let a Raspberry recognize Numbers with opencv, tesseract and the PiCamNoIRv2. 

> **Be aware that this code isn't finished yet and our code is still not fully usable**

# Files

 - **raspberry_installation_scripts** Contains shell Scripts so we have a conssitent setup over our Project. In Essence one Script takes openCV and Compiles it. It download also Tesseract and installs a Language File which is only for detecting numbers. It makes it also possible to access our Raspberry via WLAN so we dont need to have a permament wired conection to the Raspberry.
 - **image_recognition** Contains some pythonscripts which get us going to recognize some Numbers... -> Still ongoing.
